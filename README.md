import React from 'react';
import { Button } from './components/Button';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <Button label="Click Me" onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is already integrated into the project. You can use its utility classes in your JSX to quickly style components. Feel free to customize the configuration in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

      colors: {
        primary: '#1D4ED8',
